# Modeling Examples with R Tools

The following materials were originally created for professional development clinics.

* Slides (created with LaTeX) introducing compartmental models for infectious diseases with least-squres estimation are available in [OLS for SIR Models](https://github.com/arielcintronarias/modeling_r/blob/main/assets/ols_sir.pdf)
* The Jupyter notebook [] involves numerical solution of differential equations, global optimization, and bootstrap sampling (https://github.com/arielcintronarias/modeling_r/blob/main/OLS_estimation_SIR.ipynb)
