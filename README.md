# Modeling Examples with R Tools

The following materials were originally created for professional development sessions.

* Slides (created with LaTeX) introducing compartmental models for infectious diseases with least-squares estimation are available in [OLS for SIR Models](https://github.com/arielcintronarias/modeling_r/blob/main/assets/ols_sir.pdf).
* The Jupyter notebook [OLS_estimation_SIR.ipynb](https://github.com/arielcintronarias/modeling_r/blob/main/OLS_estimation_SIR.ipynb) involves numerical solution of differential equations, global optimization, and bootstrap sampling.
* An interactive map of the United States is generated with R libraries, including `highcharter` and `tidyverse`. The code is available in the notebook [maps_tidyverse.ipynb](https://github.com/arielcintronarias/modeling_r/blob/main/maps_tidyverse.ipynb) and an html-copy of the map may be downloaded from [interactive_us_map-1975.html](https://github.com/arielcintronarias/modeling_r/blob/main/interactive_us_map-1975.html).
